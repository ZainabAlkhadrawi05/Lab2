# Lab2
In this lab, an open-source Telco Customer Churn dataset was used to identify and define a machine learning problem. The dataset contains customer information related to demographics, service usage, and billing, and is provided in CSV format.

The task represents a classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their attributes. The Churn column is used as the target variable. A Jupyter Notebook was created to load and inspect the dataset, and a flowchart was designed to illustrate the overall machine learning methodology.
